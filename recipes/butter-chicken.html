    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Chicken-makhani or Butter Chicken is a dish thats close to my heart. Its a comfort food
        that I just can't get enough of and a delicacy across the world. A name
        that is so recognizable in Indian cuisine that its the defining dish
        people think of when they have a hankering for North Indian food. <br><br>

        Butter chicken is a type of curry made from chicken cooked in a spiced
        tomato and butter-based (makhan) gravy. The gravy is typically known for
        its creamy, rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which
        uses a tomato paste. The dish originates in Delhi, India. <br><br>

        The curry was allegedly developed at the Moti Mahal by Kundan Lal Jaggi
        and Kundan Lal Gujral, restaurant in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Old
        Delhi in the 1950s, after India's independance from British colonization
        and subsequent partitioning. Both the creators were Punjabi Hindu
        refugees from Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province of British
        India. The curry was made "by chance" by mixing leftover tandoori
        chicken in a tomato sauce, rich in butter (<i>makhan</i>). <br><br>

        In 1975, the English phrase "butter chicken" curry first appeared in
        print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in
        Manhattan. In Canada and the Caribbean, it can be found as a filling in
        pizza, poutine, wraps, roti, or rolls, while in Australia and New
        Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling. The curry is common in
        India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many other countries where a South
        Asian diaspora is present. Due to its popularity outside of India, it is
        sometimes mistakenly assumed to be of Western origin (like chicken tikka
        masala, which it is sometimes confused with).

    <h2>Cooking directions</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Step 1:</b> Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over
        medium-high heat. Sauté shallot and onion until soft and translucent,
        about 5 minutes. <br><br>

        <b>Step 2:</b> Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1
        teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir
        for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to
        frequently stir. <br><br>

        <b>Step 3:</b> Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and
        simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper.
        Remove from heat and set aside.<br><br>

        <b>Step 4:</b> Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet
        over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. <br><br>

        <b>Step 5:</b> Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam 
        masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until 
        liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken 
        into sauce and stir together. <br><br>
