    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Lasagna</strong>, also known by the plural form <i>lasagne</i>,
        is a type of pasta made in very wide, flat sheets. In Italian cuisine
        it is used to make the dish lasagna by stacking layers of pasta,
        alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce),
        béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella,
        and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with
        grated cheese, which melts during baking. Typically cooked pasta is
        assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven
        (<i>al forno</i>). The resulting dish is cut into single-serving square or
        rectangular portion.

        <br><br>

        Lasagna originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. The oldest known
        written reference to lasagna appears in 1282, in a ballad transcribed by
        a Bolognese notary, <em>"Pur bii del vin, comadre, e no lo temperare"</em>
        ('Just drink some wine, my woman, and do not dilute it'), part of the
        <i>Memoriali Bolognesi </i>(lit.'Bolognese Memorials'):

    <blockquote>
        <em>
            <b>"</b> Giernosen le comadre trambedue a la festa, de gliocch'e de lasagne
            se fén sette menestra <b>"</b> <br>
        </em>
        <small>— <i>Rime dei memoriali bolognesi</i> on the IntraText Digital Library</small>

        <br><br>

        <em>
            Both women went to the festival, and had seven portions of gnocchi
            and lasagne <br>
        </em>
        <small>— Translated by <i>Zancani </i> (2010), p.146</small>
        <br>
    </blockquote>

    in most countries across the world.

    <h2>Cooking directions</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Step 1:</b> Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven
        over medium heat until well browned. <br><br>

        <b>Step 2:</b> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and
        water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt,
        Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about
        1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally. <br><br>

        <b>Step 3:</b> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
        lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and
        rinse with cold water. <br><br>

        <b>Step 4:</b> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,
        remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. <br><br>

        <b>Step 5:</b> Preheat the oven to 375°F (190 C). <br><br>

        <b>Step 6:</b> To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom
        of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat
        sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese
        mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups
        meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
        <br><br>

        <b>Step 7:</b> Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and
        Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil
        with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        <br><br>

        <b>Step 8:</b> Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil
        and bake for an additional 25 minutes. <br><br>

        <b>Step 9:</b> Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. <br><br>
