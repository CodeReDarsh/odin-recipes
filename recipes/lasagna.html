    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Lasagna</strong>, also known by the plural form <i>lasagne</i>,
        is a type of pasta made in very wide, flat sheets. In Italian cuisine
        it is used to make the dish lasagna by stacking layers of pasta,
        alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce),
        béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella,
        and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with
        grated cheese, which melts during baking. Typically cooked pasta is
        assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven
        (<i>al forno</i>). The resulting dish is cut into single-serving square or
        rectangular portion.

        <br><br>

        Lasagna originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. The oldest known
        written reference to lasagna appears in 1282, in a ballad transcribed by
        a Bolognese notary, <em>"Pur bii del vin, comadre, e no lo temperare"</em>
        ('Just drink some wine, my woman, and do not dilute it'), part of the
        <i>Memoriali Bolognesi </i>(lit.'Bolognese Memorials'):

    <blockquote>
        <em>
            <b>"</b> Giernosen le comadre trambedue a la festa, de gliocch'e de lasagne
            se fén sette menestra <b>"</b> <br>
        </em>
        <small>— <i>Rime dei memoriali bolognesi</i> on the IntraText Digital Library</small>

        <br><br>

        <em>
            Both women went to the festival, and had seven portions of gnocchi
            and lasagne <br>
        </em>
        <small>— Translated by <i>Zancani </i> (2010), p.146</small>
        <br>
    </blockquote>

    Its a great comfort food and a amazing dish to celebrate special occasions.
    From parties to major holidays, you can find a lasagna adorning a table
    in most countries across the world.
